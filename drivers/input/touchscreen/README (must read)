When adding trace2sleep module (It's named trace2wake but it's for sleep. Sorry about that)
you must change the reference to the touch driver from "mtk-tpd" to your own driver (like "synaptic-xxxxxx")

You can find the reference at line 283, column 32. Just update the driver name within the quotation marks. That's it.
